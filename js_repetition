//working with arrays may not be convenient when working with lots of values being inserted in a array, so we may work with WHILE LOOPS to overcome it//

//Basically we may use 3 types of WHILE LOOPS: FOR, WHILE and DO-WHILE//


//FIRST, FOR//
//It is way better and less consuming memory if we use the following example, than typing console.log for each value//
let names = ["Mary", "John", "Peter"]

for (let i = 0; i < names.lenght; i++) {
  console.log("Name is: " + names[i])
}
/*and it'll print "Name is: Mary" and it so go on
but it may be improved by the following example: */

let names = ["Mary", "John", "Peter"]

for (index in names) {
  console.log("Name is: " + names[index])
}

//SECOND, WHILE//
let names = ["Mary", "John", "Peter"]
let count = 0

while (count < names.lenght) {
  console.log("Name is " + names[count]);
  count ++
}


//THIRD, DO...WHILE//
let names = ["Mary", "John", "Peter"]
let count = 0

do {
  console.log("Name is " + names[count]);
  count ++
} while (count < names.lenght);
